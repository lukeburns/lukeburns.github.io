# Hi, I'm Luke Burns

I'm a mathematical physicist and programmer. I am currently at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) working on a [p2p peer review platform for scientists](https://github.com/lukeburns/peer-review), learning [category theory](https://github.com/lukeburns/category-theory), and trying to [modify Dirac theory to admit photons](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac). All of [my projects are on Github](https://github.com/lukeburns). I plan to use this website to write about my projects and feelings.

Not much here yet! Come back soon.
