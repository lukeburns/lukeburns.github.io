# Hi, I'm Luke Burns

I program a bunch and study physics a bunch. I recently attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), where I built a [p2p event emitter](https://github.com/lukeburns/peer-events), toyed with a model for [open peer review](https://github.com/lukeburns/peer-review), studied some category theory, and worked on [an extension of the Dirac equation](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac). All of my work is on [Github](https://github.com/lukeburns). Here is my most recent work:

[An extension of the Dirac equation](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac/blob/master/dirac.pdf))

[Gauging duality symmetry of the generalized Maxwell equations](https://github.com/lukeburns/gauge-duality) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/gauge-duality/blob/master/maxwell.pdf))

[An introduction to geometric algebra](https://github.com/lukeburns/geometric-algebra) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/geometric-algebra/blob/master/intro.pdf))

[Is it possible to construct spinor valued gauge fields?](https://github.com/lukeburns/spinor-gauge-fields) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/spinor-gauge-fields/blob/master/fermions.pdf))
