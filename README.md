# Hi, I'm Luke Burns

I study math and physics, and code some. All of my work is on [Github](https://github.com/lukeburns). 

### Works in progress

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/76009967.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/76009967) [Does the continuity equation imply Maxwell's equations?](https://github.com/lukeburns/maxwells-equations) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/maxwells-equations/blob/master/maxwell.pdf)) The antiderivative of a divergence free multivector field is shown to be curl free up to a harmonic function. This result implies that *any* vector valued current density $J$ that is divergence free possesses a bivector valued antiderivative $F$ that satisfies $\partial F = J$ under suitable boundary conditions. In four dimensions, this is Maxwell's equation. This reinforces an existing result indicating that charge conservation can serve as a foundation for an axiomatic formulation of electrodynamics.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/69175471.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/69175471) [An extension of the Dirac equation](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac) ([pdf](https://github.com/lukeburns/dirac/blob/master/dirac.pdf))
 A minimal extension of the Dirac equation is shown to describe a pair of massless, electrically charged fermions. Solutions exhibit rotation in the particle's spin plane, analogous to the zitterbewegung of massive Dirac theory and identical to electric and magnetic fields of circularly polarized electromagnetic waves.
